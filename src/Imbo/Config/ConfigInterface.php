     * control, please take a look at the other adapters available, many of which are mutable -

     *     the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header (given the `trustedProxies` option is configured).
     *     This is the default.
     *
     * - `both`
     *     Will try to match based on both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and allow the request if
     *     any of them yields the correct signature/access token.
     *
     * - `http`
     *     Will always use `http` as the protocol, replacing `https` with `http` in the
     *     incoming URL, if that is the case.
     *
     * - `https`
     *     Will always use `https` as the protocol, replacing `http` with `https` in the

    /**
     * Event listeners
     *
     * An associative array where the keys are short names for the event listeners (not really used
     * for anything, but exists so you can override/unset some helpers from config.php). The values
     * of each element in this array can be one of the following:
     *
     * 1) A string representing a class name of a class implementing the
     *    Imbo\EventListener\ListenerInteface interface
     *
     * 2) An instance of an object implementing the Imbo\EventListener\ListenerInterface interface
     *
     * 3) A closure returning an instance of an object implementing the
     *    Imbo\EventListener\ListenerInterface interface
     *
     * 4) An array with the following keys:
     *
     *   - listener (required)
     *   - params
     *   - publicKeys
     *
     *   where 'listener' is one of the following:
     *
     *     1) a string representing a class name of a class implementing the
     *        Imbo\EventListener\ListenerInterface interface
     *
     *     2) an instance of the Imbo\EventListener\ListenerInterface interface
     *
     *     3) a closure returning an instance Imbo\EventListener\ListenerInterface
     *
     *   'params' is an array with parameters for the constructor of the event listener. This is
     *   only used when the 'listener' key is a string containing a class name.
     *
     *   'publicKeys' is an array with one of the following keys:
     *
     *     - whitelist
     *     - blacklist
     *
     *     where 'whitelist' is an array of public keys that the listener *will* trigger for, and
     *     'blacklist' is an array of public keys that the listener *will not* trigger for.
     *
     * 5) An array with the following keys:
     *
     *   - events (required)
     *   - callback (required)
     *   - priority
     *   - publicKeys
     *
     *   where 'events' is an array of events that 'callback' will subscribe to. If your callback
     *   subscribes to several events, and you want to use different priorities for the events,
     *   simply specify an associative array where the keys are the event names, and the values are
     *   the priorities for each event. If you use this method, the 'priority' key will be ignored.
     *
     *   'callback' is any callable function. The function will receive a single argument, which is
     *   an instance of Imbo\EventManager\EventInterface.
     *
     *   'priority' is the priority of your callback. This defaults to 0 (low priority). The
     *   priority can also be a negative number if you want your listeners to be triggered after
     *   Imbo's event listeners.
     *
     *   'publicKeys' is the same as described above.
     *
     * Examples of how to add listeners:
     *
     * 'eventListeners' => [
     *   // 1) A class name in a string
     *   'accessToken' => 'Imbo\EventListener\ListenerInterface',
     *
     *   // 2) Implementation of a listener interface
     *   'auth' => new EventListener\Authenticate(),
     *
     *   // 3) Implementation of a listener interface with a public key filter
     *   'maxImageSize' => [
     *     'listener' => EventListener\MaxImageSize(1024, 768),
     *     'publicKeys' => [
     *       'whitelist' => [ ... ],
     *       // 'blacklist' => [ ... ],
     *       )
     *     )
     *   ),
     *
     *   // 4) A class name in a string with custom parameters for the listener
     *   'statsAccess' => [
     *       'listener' => 'Imbo\EventListener\StatsAccess',
     *       'params' => [
     *           'allow' => ['127.0.0.1', '::1'],
     *       ],
     *   ],
     *
     *   // 5) A closure that will subscribe to two events with different priorities
     *   'anotherCustomCallback' => [
     *       'callback' => function($event) {
     *           // Some code
     *       },

     *           'image.post' => -20, // Trigger AFTER the internal handler for "image.post"

     * Trusted proxies

     * If you find yourself behind some sort of proxy - like a load balancer - then certain header

     * HTTP header is usually used to return the requested host. But when you're behind a proxy,
     * the true host may be stored in a X-Forwarded-Host header.
     *
     * Since HTTP headers can be spoofed, Imbo does not trust these proxy headers by default.

     * Note: Not all proxies set the required X-Forwarded-* headers by default. A search for
     *       "X-Forwarded-Proto <your proxy here>" usually gives helpful answers to how you can
     *       add them to incoming requests.
